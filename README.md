Easy TikTok comment and auto scroll made in python<p>
Required: pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)<p>
You can use Bluestacks with TikTok App or instead use their Desktop app or browser.<p>
You will need to change the pointer location values by running "get_mouse_loc.py" from terminal and keeping pointer at its location<p>
Im sure you will figure it out :)
